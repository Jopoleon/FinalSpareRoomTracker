# FinalSpareRoomTracker

SpareRoomTracker
 <br> 	<p> The first big project, you can add the area of tracking apartments by the name of the area in London, and when new ads appear, 
 an alert will be sent to the mail.
It is tracked using background goroutine. Spareroom.com does not have an API, so you have to make http requests and parse html body
to get necessary information. I used MongoDB as database. <p/> <br>
Partial functionality deployed on Heroku: https://spareroomgolang.herokuapp.com
